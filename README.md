Having 3 years of experience working as a data analyst in the industry, have taught me to be a quick thinker, solve challenging problems, and communicate with Business stakeholders.
I always look forward to deliver the expectations set and I am capable of being effective team player and handling things on my own too. 

In my spare time, I like to travel ðŸš— , listen to music :headphones: and watch movies/TV Series :tv:.

I enjoy trying out emerging technologies and connecting with people across a wide range of backgrounds. 
If you ever want to bounce ideas off of me or even just have a chat, please feel free to reach out. ðŸ˜„
